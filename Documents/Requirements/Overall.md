## Overview

A traditional family network app that visualizes your entire extended family as an interactive tree.  
Connects generations through profiles and stories in a private, heritage-focused community.

In the app, there are three primary entities:

* [Family](./Family.md): Represents a single family unit, comprising a group of family members. This entity may also include pets as part of the family structure.

* [FamilyMember](./FamilyMember.md): Represents an individual within a family tree. This includes all relatives and ancestors, regardless of whether they use the app.

* [User](./User.md): An application user who logs in to view and interact with the family tree. Every user must be a family member. However, not all family members are users by default â€” only those who register and log in gain access to the application.
