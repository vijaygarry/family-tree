## Application Users

An application user who logs in to view and interact with the family tree. Every user must be a family member. However, not all family members are users by default â€” only those who register and log in gain access to the application.

### Application User Attributes

An application user includes the following attributes:

- **Logon Name**:  
  A login name that is either auto-generated by the system (e.g., `firstname.lastname`) or specified by the user during registration.

- **User ID**:  
  A system-assigned unique identifier created at the time of registration. This value is immutable.

- **Password**:  
  A securely stored, one-way hashed password used for authentication.

- **First Name**:  
  The user's given name.

- **Last Name**:  
  The user's family name or surname.

- **Email ID**:  
  The user's registered email address, used for login and communication.

- **Member ID**:  
  A reference to the corresponding family member record.

> **Note**: The first name, last name and email of the user must always remain synchronized with the associated family member's first, last name and email.


### User Permissions

Registered users are assigned roles that determine their access and capabilities within the application. The roles are defined as follows:

- **Individual User**:  
  - Can view all families and their members.  
  - Has access to events, news, and account information.  
  - Can update their own profile only.

- **Family Admin**:  
  - Inherits all permissions of an Individual User.  
  - Can manage and update family details.  
  - Can add or modify profiles of any member within their family.

- **App Admin**:  
  - Inherits all permissions of a Family Admin.  
  - Can create and update any family in the system.

- **Super Admin**:  
  - Has unrestricted access and can perform all actions across the entire application.
